### Raymarching WordArt!
- I achieve the greetings part on small intro! yay!
  - did any attempt there?
- make distance field texture of words using canvas2D and shader

### Super Glitch!
- audio-visual sync sick glitch fx
- procedural music using shader, so that I could use same glitch timing function on both shaders
- also `String.fromCharCode( pow( random(), 4 ) * 65536 )` is fun

### And so many other features!
- IFS fractal geometry
- edge detection using gap of normals
  - red line on blue background is reallllly cool
- wtf blue portally something (spins with snare shot!)
- gooooood snare sound

### minifier hell!
- "To minify, you have to code it longer (means more beautiful)"
- because beautiful code is easy to pattern matching
- `while( true ) { say( "Thank You" ); }`: [Shader Minifier by Ctrl+Alt+Test]()
- also [/packer/](http://dean.edwards.name/packer/) is good (but finally it did only 5% compression...🙀)
- I had no time! if I have plenty of time, I can minify it more...

### Drink!
- i am addicted for gin and kahlua
- chai tea is also good, but hard to find

### Food!
- which do you like?
  - doritos
  - cheetos
- btw i like chips
